***
Grbl-Advanced is a no-compromise, high performance, low cost alternative for CNC milling. This version of Grbl-Advanced runs on a STM32F411 Nucleo Board.

It accepts standards-compliant g-code and has been tested with the output of several CAM tools with no problems. Arcs, circles and helical motion are fully supported, as well as, all other primary g-code commands. Macro functions, variables, and most canned cycles are not supported, but we think GUIs can do a much better job at translating them into straight g-code anyhow.

Grbl-Advanced includes full acceleration management with look ahead. That means the controller will look up to 16 motions into the future and plan its velocities ahead to deliver smooth acceleration and jerk-free cornering.

* Built on the wonderful Grbl v1.1 (2017) firmware written by Sungeun "Sonny" Jeon, Ph.D. (USA).

### Extras:
#### Backlash Compensation:
Backlash compensation enabled by default.
Edit defaults.h to your needs.

* $140=(X Backlash [mm])
* $141=(Y Backlash [mm])
* $142=(Z Backlash [mm])

#### Canned Drill Cycles (G81-G83):
Added Canned Drill Cycles G81-G83 as additional features. 

#### 5-Axis support
Added experimental support for rotary axis (5-axis). They are roughly tested and may contain still errors. Use at own risk!

#### Lathe mode
G33 / G76 (Requires rotary encoder)

#### Hard Reset
0x19 (CTRL-Y): Perform a hard reset.

#### Tools
* $14=(tool change mode): 0 = Ignore M6; 1 = Manual Tool Change; 2 = Manual Tool Change + TLS; 3 = Tool Table
* $P: Save TLS position
* $T: Confirm tool change
* $Tx: Print parameters of Tool Nr x (Supports Tool Nr 0-19)
* $Tx=[0.0:0.0:0.0:0.0] (Save new parameters of Tool x: X, Y, Z, Reserved)
* $RST=T: Reset all tool tables saved in EEPROM

Uses Dynamic TLO when $14 = (2 or 3)

#### I2C EEPROM
Added support for external 1Kb EEPROM (e.g. ST M24C08). Enable 'USE_EXT_EEPROM' in Config.h.

#### ETHERNET Support
GRBL-Advanced can be controlled with USB or ETHERNET. For ETHERNET an additional W5500 Module is required. Then enable USE_ETH_IF in Config.h. The default IP Address is 192.168.1.20 : 30501.
Use [Candle 2](https://github.com/Schildkroet/Candle2) as control interface.

#### Attention
By default, settings are stored in internal flash memory in last sector. First startup takes about 5-10sec to write all settings.
